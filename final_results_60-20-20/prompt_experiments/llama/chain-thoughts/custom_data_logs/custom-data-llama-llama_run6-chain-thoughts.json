Predicting the values type, these appear to be strings (non-numeric and non-date).\n3. Comparing against each option:\n\t* medical_boolean: unlikely, as there's no clear indication of true/false values.\n\t* gender: possible, but some options might not clearly indicate a specific gender.\n\t* case_status: also possible, but the words don't immediately suggest any specific status.\n\t* age: unlikely, since ages are typically represented by numbers.\n\t* occupation: unlikely, as these words don't appear to describe jobs or professions.\n\t* symptoms: possible, but the words might not clearly indicate physical or mental symptoms.\n\t* outcome: unlikely, as outcomes are typically represented by specific results (e.g., \"cured,\" \"deceased\").\n\t* contact_setting: unlikely, since this option suggests a specific context for interaction (e.g., phone, in-person).\n\t* location: possible, but the words might not clearly indicate a specific geographic location.\n\t* date: unlikely, as dates are typically represented by numbers or formatted strings.\n\t* id: unlikely, since IDs are usually numeric or alphanumeric codes.\n\n4.
