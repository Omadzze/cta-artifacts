      "3. Comparing against each option:\n",
      "\t* - age: unlikely, as age is typically a numeric value (int).\n",
      "\t* - id: unlikely, as an ID might be a unique number or identifier.\n",
      "\t* - outcome: possible, but the values 'y' and 'n' don't suggest a typical medical outcome measurement.\n",
      "\t* - case_status: possible, but still unsure if this matches the input.\n",
      "\t* - symptoms: unlikely, as symptoms are often more detailed descriptions of patient experiences.\n",
      "\t* - contact_setting: unlikely, as this sounds more related to data collection or survey settings.\n",
      "\t* - occupation: unlikely, as this is unrelated to the medical context suggested by the input values.\n",
      "\t* - date: unlikely, as dates would typically be formatted in a specific way (e.g., 'YYYY-MM-DD').\n",
      "\t* - gender: unlikely, as this is typically represented with a more detailed value set (e.g., male/female).\n",
      "\t* - location: unlikely, as this might relate to where data was collected but not directly related to the input values.\n",
      "4. After comparing against each option, medical_boolean appears to be the best fit, as it represents a simple true/false or yes/no answer that is commonly used in medical contexts.\n"
