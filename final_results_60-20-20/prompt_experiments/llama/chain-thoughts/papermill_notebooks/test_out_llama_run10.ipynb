      "- gender, occupation, location: These categories imply more structured types of data and don't fit as well with \"oui\" and \"non\".\n",

      "   - **- location**: The INPUT does not provide any geographical information that would suggest 'location'.\n",
      "   - **- medical_boolean**: This suggests something binary regarding medical conditions. However, given the variety of conditions listed (some chronic, some acute, etc.), this seems too restrictive for a label like \"medical_boolean\".\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Identify key features in the INPUT:\n",
      "\t* The INPUT consists of a series of alphanumeric strings, each with a mix of letters and digits.\n",
      "\t* Some strings have a consistent pattern of \"0\"s at the beginning or end (e.g., e0t0q90drq00).\n",
      "2. Predict value types:\n",
      "\t* Based on the alphanumeric nature of the strings, it's likely that these are not dates or integers.\n",
      "\t* The presence of digits suggests they might be identifiers or codes rather than categorical values.\n",
      "3. Compare against each option:\n",
      "\t* - outcome: Unlikely, as outcomes typically have more descriptive labels (e.g., \"positive,\" \"negative\").\n",
      "\t* - case_status: Also unlikely, as status would usually be a more concise code (e.g., \"open,\" \"closed\").\n",
      "\t* - gender: Highly unlikely, as genders are categorical values with limited possibilities (e.g., male, female).\n",
      "\t* - date: Unlikely, as the strings don't resemble dates in standard formats.\n",
      "\t* - occupation: Possible, but occupations would typically be more descriptive codes or labels (e.g., \"engineer,\" \"nurse\").\n",
      "\t* - location: Unlikely, as locations might have more geographic specificity (e.g., city, country).\n",
      "\t* - medical_boolean: Possible, as these strings could represent binary medical conditions (0s and 1s are not used, but the pattern suggests a similar concept).\n",
      "\t* - contact_setting: Possible, as this option has a somewhat technical or coded tone that matches the alphanumeric nature of the INPUT.\n",
      "\t* - symptoms: Unlikely, as symptoms would usually be more descriptive text or labels.\n",
      "\t* - age: Highly unlikely, as ages are numerical values (not strings with mixtures of letters and digits).\n",
      "\t* - id: Most likely, as these strings resemble unique identifiers or codes often used in databases.\n",
