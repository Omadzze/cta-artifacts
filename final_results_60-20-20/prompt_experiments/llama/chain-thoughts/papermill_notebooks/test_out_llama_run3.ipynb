      "1. **Identify the key features in the INPUT:**\n",
      "   - The input contains three elements: \"oui\", \"non\", and \"inc\".\n",
      "   - These are all short strings, suggesting they might represent yes/no or boolean-like values (\"oui\" meaning \"yes\" in French, \"non\" meaning \"no\", and \"inc\" possibly being an abbreviation for \"included\").\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Predict the value type:**\n",
      "   - Based on their composition and context (logical choices), it seems these are string representations of boolean values.\n",
      "   \n",
      "3. **Compare against each option to see which matches best:**\n",
      "   - **- id:** IDs are typically integers or specific strings (like UUIDs) for identification, not short labels like \"oui\", \"non\", and \"inc\".\n",
      "   - **- date:** This represents a calendar date, which does not match the input.\n",
      "   - **- contact_setting:** While settings could be represented by such strings, it's less common than other options to represent boolean-like values.\n",
      "   - **- outcome:** Outcomes can be any string but typically are more descriptive and not limited to yes/no choices.\n",
      "   - **- location:** A location would usually be a geographical description or a specific address, which doesn't fit the input.\n",
      "   - **- medical_boolean:** This option suggests a boolean value related to medicine. Given \"oui\", \"non\", and \"inc\" could represent yes/no values with \"inc\" possibly indicating an inclusion condition (though somewhat unclear without context), this seems like a good match but let's review further options.\n",
      "   - **- age:** Age is typically represented by integers, not by strings of different types like those in the input.\n",
      "   - **- case_status:** While status could be represented with short strings, it often doesn't include boolean-like values without context.\n",
      "   - **- occupation:** An occupation would usually require a more descriptive string than what's given here.\n",
      "   - **- symptoms:** Symptoms are detailed conditions and wouldn't fit the format of \"oui\", \"non\", \"inc\" as direct representations.\n",
      "   - **- gender:** Gender is typically represented by one of a limited set of strings (\"male\", \"female\", etc.), but it doesn't fit well with the \"inc\" value.\n",
