      "\n",
      "2. Predict values type: Based on their appearance and typical usage, these words seem to be labels or categories rather than numerical data or dates.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Compare against each option:\n",
      "   - id: Typically a unique identifier, not matching the descriptive nature of INPUT.\n",
      "   - outcome: Could be a possibility since it sounds like an evaluation or classification; however, there's no clear evidence that this is what the input represents.\n",
      "   - date: Does not match as these are words rather than dates.\n",
      "   - medical_boolean: This typically refers to true/false values in a medical context. The INPUT does not indicate boolean (true/false) value representation.\n",
      "   - occupation: Similar to \"outcome,\" it sounds plausible, but there's no indication that these represent occupations or categories of work.\n",
      "   - case_status: Sounds like a category or status for something. Given the nature of INPUT as simple, single-word labels (\"inc\", \"non\", and \"oui\"), this option seems promising because it suggests categorization or classification.\n",
      "   - location: Does not match since these words do not indicate geographical locations.\n",
      "   - symptoms: This is typically associated with health issues a person might be experiencing. The INPUT does not suggest that the items are related to symptoms.\n",
      "   - contact_setting: Suggests something about how someone was contacted, which doesn't fit well with the short labels provided.\n",
      "   - age: Clearly does not match since these words do not indicate numerical ages or any sort of numeric data.\n",
      "   - gender: Does not match because these labels (\"inc\", \"non\", and \"oui\") do not represent male/female classifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Based on step 3, case_status seems the most fitting as it implies a classification or categorization status for something, which aligns well with the INPUT being simple, single-word labels indicating some form of categorization or evaluation (\"inc\" might stand for \"included,\" \"non\" possibly means not included, and \"oui\" could mean yes in French).\n",

      "   - \"inconnu\" is not a known quantity, but it's likely to be a string or a code.\n",

      "3. **Comparing against each option**:\n",
      "   - **id**: Typically refers to a unique identifier, which doesn't match the description of \"inconnu\", \"oui\", or \"non\".\n",
      "   - **outcome**: This seems like the best fit as it typically involves results or conclusions from something that has happened or been observed.\n",
      "   - **date**: Does not match since dates are specific times on a calendar and none of \"inconnu\", \"oui\", or \"non\" suggest temporal information.\n",
      "   - **medical_boolean**: A boolean is usually represented by true/false. While \"oui\"/\"non\" could be translated to yes/no, the option here specifically mentions \"boolean,\" which suggests it's looking for binary data rather than categorical responses like yes/no.\n",
