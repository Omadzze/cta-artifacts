      "   - **medical_boolean**: This would indicate a true or false condition, which doesn't fit well with \"notvacc\", \"doseunk\".\n",
      "   - **gender**: Does not apply to vaccination status.\n",
      "   - **case_status**: Could be a status but is too broad and doesn’t specifically match the vaccine context directly.\n",

However, among the options provided, **symptoms** could be considered a broad enough category that might encompass descriptions of vaccination status indirectly.
