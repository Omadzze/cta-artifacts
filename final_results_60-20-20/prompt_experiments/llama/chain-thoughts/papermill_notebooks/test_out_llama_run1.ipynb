      "1. **Identify key features**: The input consists of three strings: \"inc\", \"non\", and \"oui\".\n",
      "2. **Predict value types**: Given that all elements are strings representing categories or labels (\"inc\" likely stands for \"included,\" \"non\" for \"none,\" and \"oui\" is French for \"yes\"), it suggests the values are not numbers, dates, or boolean in the traditional sense but rather categorical data.\n",
      "3. **Compare against options**:\n",
      "   - **date**: The input does not represent a date; thus, this option does not apply.\n",
      "   - **occupation**: While occupation could be represented by strings, the context here suggests something more general and less specific to professions.\n",
      "   - **location**: Similarly, \"location\" would involve geographical information which is not indicated in [inc, non, oui].\n",
      "   - **medical_boolean**: The presence of \"oui\" (which translates to \"yes\") among other labels hints at a binary or categorial value set that could be related to medical outcomes but does not explicitly indicate a boolean value.\n",
      "   - **age**: Clearly, the input is not about age.\n",
      "   - **outcome**: This option suggests an evaluation or result of some sort. The presence of categorical values (\"inc\", \"non\", and \"oui\") hints at an outcome or status classification.\n",
      "   - **id**: The input does not resemble any form of identification.\n",
      "   - **symptoms**: While symptoms could be described with strings, the context here is more about categorization rather than detailing specific conditions.\n",

      "1. **Identify key features**: The INPUT contains two elements: `inc` and `non`. These are short forms or abbreviations that could represent different categories or classifications.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Predict value type**: Without additional context, these seem to be strings rather than numerical types like integers (int) or dates.

      "\n",
      "3. **Compare against each option**: Given the options:\n",
      "   - `date` seems unlikely since `[inc, non]` does not resemble a typical date format.\n",
      "   - `occupation`, `location`, and similar categories seem unrelated to short forms like `inc` and `non`.\n",
      "   - `medical_boolean` could be a possibility if we interpret these as a yes/no or active/inactive status in medical terms. However, the context given doesn't specifically suggest this interpretation directly.\n",
      "   - `age`, `outcome`, `id`, `symptoms`, `case_status`, `gender`, and `contact_setting` all seem unlikely since they represent different types of data that aren't immediately suggested by `[inc, non]`.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Return final answer**: Considering the options provided and assuming a medical context where \"inc\" could mean \"included\" or \"active,\" and \"non\" means \"not included\" or \"inactive,\" it seems most fitting to classify these as related to `medical_boolean`, suggesting they might be on/off, active/inactive statuses in some context.\n",

      "   - medical_boolean: Given the format and possible interpretation as boolean values, this seems like a good fit, especially since it mentions \"medical\" and could imply yes/no answers for certain conditions.\n",

      "   - id: Would usually be a unique identifier and could be any data type but often a string or integer in practice, which does not directly fit.\n",
      "   - symptoms: Could imply a range of possible inputs including text descriptions, which doesn't match the format here.\n",
      "   - case_status: Might involve strings to describe statuses (like pending/resolved) but can also include other data types; it doesn't exactly fit what we're looking at.\n",
      "   - gender: Would typically be one of several categories described by a string (e.g., male/female), which is not in line with the input given.\n",
      "   - contact_setting: Without further context, this could be anything from strings to numerical values but does not directly match our binary data.\n",
